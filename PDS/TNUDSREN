%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD                                                             +

%Please check the report+from your%rename+or%check+job carefully.
+The following are reasons why datasets may not be renamed:
%
%1)+HSM migrated datasets can not be renamed. Either%HDELETE+them if they are
+   not needed or%HRECALL+them, then re-run the utility when they have been
+   recalled.%Datasets will not be HDELETEd or HRECALLed automatically
%
%2)+For each dataset to be renamed,%RACF+is checked to see if your user has
+   authority to do the renaming. If not, no renaming is done.
%
%3)+Datasets on%tape+or%cartridge+and%GDGs+will not be renamed by this utility
+   If you have any and need help, please contact%Security Development+on%87709
%
%4)+ISPF%profile+datasets will not be renamed. If you want to model your%new+
+   ISPF profile on an%old+one, please use the separate utility on%S.PU+
%
%5)+If the proposed new name for a dataset%already exists,+the rename will not
+   be attempted. The report will explain why the rename was not done.
%
%6)+If a dataset is%allocated+to another%job+or%user,+the rename will fail
